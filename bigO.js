    Take the algorthms you wrote for Weeks 1-2. Review
    your solutions and estimate the time and space complexity.

    After thinking about the time and space complexity, start thinking about
    how you could improve the time complexity.

    Most interviewers only care about time complexity. Mainly
    because space complexity isn't that big of a deal because memory (storage)
    is cheap but time is not. 

    Note that as we try to improve the time complexity of an algorithm,
    the space complexity will always get worse. Think of a see-saw.
