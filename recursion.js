/*
   Problem #1: repeater(char)

   Write a function that takes an input character and returns that character 
   repeated 5 times using recursion. 

   For example, if the input is 'g', then the output should be 'ggggg'.

*/

const repeater = (char) => {};

/*

factorial(num)
Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.

4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24, so calling factorial(4) should return 24.

note: You can add an additional parameter for storage:

(num, product = 1)
*/

const factorial = (num) => {};

/*
 
getLength(array)
Get the length of an array using recursion without accessing its length property.

note: You can add an additional parameter for storage:

(length = 0)

*/

const getLength = (array) => {};

/*

shuffleCards(topHalf, bottomHalf)

You are creating a card game application with your friend.
She already wrote a function that divides the deck of cards into top and bottom halves, 
but needs help writing a function that shuffles the two halves together again.

Write a function that takes two arrays as inputs, representing the top and bottom halves
of a deck of cards, and shuffles them together. 

The function will return a single array containing the elements from both input arrays
interleaved, like so:

  - first element should be the first element of the first input array,
  - second element should be the first element of the second input array,
  - and so on.

  test case:
  const topHalf = ['Queen of Diamonds', 'Five of Hearts', 'Ace of Spades', 'Eight of Clubs'];
  const bottomHalf = ['Jack of Hearts', 'Ten of Spades'];
  ['Queen of Diamonds', 'Jack of Hearts', 'Five of Hearts', 'Ten of Spades', 'Ace of Spades', 'Eight of Clubs']
